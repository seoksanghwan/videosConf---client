redux - how to [ref] select in [mapDispatchToProps]

I'm currently working on [react] using [redux], but I don't know how to get [refs] from [mapDispatchToProps] inside [component].

my component event function code

    this.webrtc.attachStream(stream ,this.remoteVideos[peer.id]);

my component render code

    <video ref={(v) => this.remoteVideos[data.id] = v} playsInline />


container code(mapDispatchToProps)

    rtc.on('videoAdded', (stream, peer) => {
       dispatch({
          type : ADD_MEDIA ,
          peer,
          stream
        });
     })

The code I'm trying to do

    rtc.on('videoAdded', (stream, peer) => {
       dispatch({
          type : ADD_MEDIA ,
          peer,
          stream : rtc.attachStream(stream ,this.remoteVideos[peer.id]);
        });
     })

but fail.. code 
I must select [ref] from within [mapDispatchToProps] called [this.remoteVideos]

When I asked the question, I turned the translator around and asked the question. I'm sorry the sentence isn't smooth. I turned the translator.
